# Customer Churn Prediction – Telco Dataset

Predicting which customers are likely to leave using machine learning.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Telecom companies lose significant revenue due to customer churn. This project analyzes customer data to predict churn and recommend actions to reduce loss.

## 💡 Key Business Insights
- ~27% of customers in the dataset churned.
- Monthly charges and contract type were strong predictors.
- Model allows proactive targeting of at-risk customers.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Power BI / Streamlit (for dashboard)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git, GitHub

## 🔍 Workflow Overview

1. **Data Cleaning** – Removed nulls, encoded categoricals.
2. **EDA** – Analyzed churn by contract type, payment method, tenure.
3. **Modeling** – Trained and evaluated Logistic Regression, Random Forest.
4. **Results** – ROC-AUC: 0.82, Accuracy: 78%
5. **Business Impact** – Can reduce churn through targeting and plan redesign.
